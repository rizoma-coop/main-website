<p>We created this this community-run grocery store as a way to offer access to healthy, sustainable, ecological and ethical products at reasonable prices for the consumer, and fair prices for the producers.</p>
<p>Mini-Rizoma belongs to all of its members and you will find each and every one of them working their part! Whether it is at the cash register, cleaning the store, or serving coffee, everybody works for everybody else in a space that belongs to all.</p>
