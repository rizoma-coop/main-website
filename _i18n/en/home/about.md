<p><i>In botany, a type of stem that grows horizontally is called a rhizome (in portuguese, “rizoma”).</i></p>

<p>As a <a href="{% tl coop %}">cooperative</a>, we too, aspire to grow horizontally in an organic and democratic fashion.</p>

<p>Like the rhizome, we want our community to become a support network, by offering basic consumer goods in an economically, ecologically, and socially responsible way.</p>
