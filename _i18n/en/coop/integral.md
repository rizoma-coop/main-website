<p>We started by opening a community grocery store, but the cooperative can become much more than that to help solve social and economic problems beyond just food consumption. That's why we registered the cooperative as a <strong>multi-sector cooperative</strong>, which will have several sectors of activity: the “consumer sector”, which manages the grocery store, is the only one that is currently active, but in the future we hope to open sectors for agriculture, commercialization, culture, services, and even housing.</p>

<p>This means that we can integrate all kinds of projects areas that, in the long term, provide our community of members with a democratic tool to develop a community-based, cooperative economy.</p>

<p>When a new member joins Rizoma, they have to choose which sector they want to join, and for each one there is a minimum of social titles they have to participate with. But that's for later! For now, there is only the consumer sector which requires a minimum of 3 shares (5€ each).
