<p>The core of Rizoma's organization are its working groups (or grupos de trabalho, “GT” for short). In each GT there is a representative, who has the role of the GT spokesperson at the monthly General Meetings, and a coordinator, who represents the GT in the also-monthly Coordination Circle. Each GT determines how it distributes responsibilities and makes decisions, ideally through the consent of all active GT members.</p>

<p>At least once a month, during the General Meeting, decisions about the organization of Rizoma are made jointly by consent. All Rizoma members are welcome to attend this meeting and help make decisions.</p>

<p>Twice a year, Rizoma members meet in a General Assembly, where topics such as the annual budget, the strategic plan and possible changes to the general internal rules and statutes are decided. The quorum for the General Assembly is 50% of active members and decisions are made by a qualified majority of 3⁄4 of votes.</p>
